# Readme

I built this after trying to decide what conferences to go to for the upcoming year and realizing I couldn't find a simple list of upcoming conferences in bitcoin.

## Adding a Conference

This website is (hopefully!) community maintained. If you know of a bitcoin conference you'd like to see added to the site, you can:

1. Open a PR adding a file in `content/posts/` with the follwing structure:

```md
---
title: "bitcoin++"
link: "https://btcplusplus.dev/conf/atx25"
date: "2025-05-07"
location: "Austin"
---
```

2. Open an [Issue](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit/bitcoinconferences.info/issues/new), mentioning the conference you propose be added, along with the data required (see code block above).
